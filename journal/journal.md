*Geometric Drawing Mahcine*

This project is related to mine because it shows off the basic idea of a drawing machine. The project uses similar technology to what I am planning on using for my final piece with the cogs playing a major roll in how the machine runs. This very basic and easy to build geometric drawing machine works by having two arms connected to the turning cogs moving the pen in a circular motion in doing so creating mesmerizing geometric patterns. Looking into machines like this it allowed for me to find a basic level of the technology required in order to create a project like this. With my machine however, I will have to model it more after a legitimate tattoo machine rather than a drawing machine like this. The concept as well as the technology sometimes crosses over between the two allowing me to use aspects of both.

*Vibration Motor Drawing Machine*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp7MkqE4xIw*

This machine is a DIY drawing machine that utilises a vibration motor, battery pack and pens. The machine is designed with the pens arranged together facing outwards and the motor in the middle between them all. As the motor runs the pens are shaken and moved around causing patterns and lines to be drawn on whatever surface the machine is placed on. Again, this is a very simple drawing machine but the technology used is similar to that I plan on using in my own project. By seeing how the motor could be used to move the pens in this manner, it made me think whether I could design something similar to this with the pen being driven up and down casuing the dotted effect rather than having the pens move side to side creating lines. By designing the project to be similar to this one in would eliminate the need for a cog and cam shaft driving the pen up and down but in doing so would make the project more simple and basic. Maybe there is a happy medium between the two ideas that I can begin to look into such as purchasing and testing out one of these vibration motors and testing with and without the cam shaft. Making this project I want to design it as similar to a tattoo machine as possible. In doing so not only can it be used as a drawing machine but could also be refined and produced as a machine for an apprentice to use to produce work with as practice for tattooing. I feel that the vibration motor would come in handy when trying to create a machine similar to a regular rotary tattoo machine.

*Drill Drawing Machine *

*https://kash1985.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/rough-drawing-machine-ideas/*

![Image](drill.jpg)

When researching different drawing machines I came across this piece which at frist was simply included because I found it quite funny and while yes it was a drawing machine it seemed like quite a joke however, the more I began to think about it the technology could actuallly be used in one way or another. The basic idea behind the piece is that a ball with pens, pencils or ink is connected to a drill and when the drill is turned on and put against a canvas the drill moves the ball creating different outcomes of lines and in term creating "art". In all honesty, the idea is pretty cool and something I had never really thought about using but the idea would work quite well if you were completing work on a larger scale and needing an automated way of doing so. If there was a way to utilise the technology of a drill to drive a pen in a back and fourth motion I could consider using this in my project however, the issues I would have in doing so would be the sheer size and power of the drill. I think that this would end up becomming a big issue for me in the future. The idea is still something I find intersting and would like to play with more in future I just think the power and size would take away from the project.

*Simple Tatttoo Machine *

*https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cgX_soyzV/*

![Image](penmachine.jpg)

These next few projects started getting me very excited. Seeing that people have played with ideas like this as well as exploring the world of these simple build tattoo machines is something that I find extremely interesting. This project was sent to me by my tattoo artist after we had a night of painting together and I had explained to him what I was currently working on at uni. The instagram page is a collection of tattoo machines built by this artist. Each machine is built from everyday materails such as hollowed out pens etc. This was like a wave of ideas after seeing this, and was actually the reason I had the idea for building my machine the way I intend to build it for the final. For example, the hollowed out pen makes for a great housing unit for a smaller pen to be used and can be swapped out for different colours or sizes. The technology used for these machines can be made or bought quite easily too making it easy for me to build. The only big difference between this machine and something I can make would be the motor size and the quality of the cam shaft/cog system. By using the Microbit it limits the power of the motor that can be used which is a shame but still allows me to create a working machine, it just won't be as powerful as those shown by this artist.

*Dotworker *

![Image](dotworker.png)

This project is by far both my favourite and the most useful for me when designing the project. Here you can pretty much see exaclty what I am aiming to build. The project shows off this idea I've been toying with perfectly, a machine that can be used for creating dotwork projects similar to producing a tattoo. The technology used is pretty much the same as what I am trying to achieve (Although mine is much less professional). I just found this project to be everything I wanted to produce and it gave me a very well thought out, clean version of the conceptual idea I had been playing with ove the past few weeks. Surprisingly, this is the only fully developed project I found that was pretty much exactly what I was wanting to produce. In seeing this I have realsied this is a very niche market for the project I am wanting to produce, this has both good and bad qualities to it. On the plus side if the product were to go to market there would be no real competition. Then on the downside there is no telling how big or small the market for such a product is.

*Pen Style Tattoo Machine *

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Q8sdJDMog*

![Image](pentattoo3.jpg)

The final project I have chosen to include is a modern tattoo machine that is modelled after a pen to be lightweight and comfortable for the user. The design of this piece is the aspect that I had taken in the most, it's very clean and lightweight while still looking professional. In a perfect world I would have loved to create a model based upon this machine to 3D print for my project however, with the current times that just isn't possible. In saying this though I would like to produce something as similar to this machine as possible to keep the look of a tattoo machine, a lot of the drawing machines I have shown previously are modelled off of old school coil machines. They all look very heavy and would be painful to use over an extended period of time, but if they were to be modelled like this machine with a very light material for its casing it would feel no different to holding a larger marker. 

## Other research ##

*TÂ³: 3D Printing a Rotary Tattoo Machine:*

*https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2165*

*This source was a fun blog post showing how you could use a 3D printer to develop a very basic tattoo machine. I had come across this page within the first few weeks of researching this concept and was amazed that you could do such a thing, giving me the idea to 3D print elements of my project. While we may not be able to 3D print due to this current situation I still have taken elements from this source that can be used within my own project such as the build itself. The source details how to build the machine itself with each part being shown in the video, a lot of these ideas I have played with and want to use with my final piece to make sure it works in a similar way to these 3D printed machines*

*How to make your own tattoo machine:*

*https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/zmgz9x/heres-how-to-make-your-own-tattoo-machine*

*This Vice article details the many different ways you could build a DIY tattoo machine talking about the base aspects that need to be build and how you can produce these with vary simple household tools. Funnily enough, most of the machine's built within the piece could all be accomplished with things I have laying around the house. This article to me was a great way of coming up with designs of how this project was going to look, since we don't have access to a lot of the more professional equipment supplied by the university I have turned to going with the more personally built look. The machine is something produced for me and while I do want it to look clean and not as though it will fall apart within a few minutes I do want it to keep that homemade feel to it like some of the machines shown within this piece. It's honestly surprising how informative this was for me detailing each and every aspect that was needed and allowing me to come up with a very simple but effective design draft.*

*How to setup a tatoo machine:*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WhIYi9d_yw*

*This is a basic instructional video on how to setup a tattoo machine. I've icluded this source as it showed how a machine should be setup and how I should be designing my project, by modelling the project as a legitimate machine it makes it as interactive as posible. The video also shows all the elements of a tatoo machine that I would like to try and replicate in my drawing machine, as hard as it may be to create some of these I would like to make it as close as possible to a tattoo machine.*


*History of Mechanical Design and Machine Drawing in the School of AMME
By Andrei Lozzi*

*http://web.aeromech.usyd.edu.au/history-chapters/C6%20Design.pdf*

*This research paper goes through a wide variety of designs in terms of drawing machines throughout history. Dating back to the pre 1950's as well as describing how far we have comes in terms of those machines that we see on a daily basis. This source was an interesting way to see a wide variety of different designs for drawing machines that I coule potentially borrow elements from to design my own interactive project. It's also just amazing to see how far we have come in terms of both design and the art world, something I had never really considered up until this point. One of the biggest things mentioned is the development of CAD software and what this has done for the design world. Having never used or really thought of programs such as these prior to this year I find it incredibly interesting to delve deeper into that world of design. This relates to my project as I am currently designing a 3D models in Fusion360 and this could be used to print parts for my final project. 

*TATTOO MACHINE , THE EVOLUTION BEHIND THE HARDWARE*
By Tattoo Buddha*

*https://medium.com/@TattooBuddha/tattoo-machine-the-evolution-behind-the-hardware-b09a6bf26ec9*

*I came across this article when research the history of tattoo machine's design wanting to find where the biggest changes occured as well as taking in information on the elements that each iteration contained and seeing if anything could be replicated with my small array of reseources. The most interesting thing I found from this article was just how long the rotrary machine took to become a thing in the tattoo world. It actually amazed me that coil machines were in rotation from eaerly 1920's to 1978 when the frist rotary was deisgned and began to be sold. A magnetic coil machine is the first and classic machine which uses an alternating electromagnetic current to pass through coils and turn magnets on and off in rapid succession. This pulls a spring loaded armature bar and creates an up and down motion, which results in the armature bar tapping the needles into the skin. Whereas, the rotary machine is a small spinning motor attached to an armature, which produces an up and down motion. Rotary machines are much quieter than coil machines and are known to move the needles more smoothly and evenly in comparison to coil. While I do love coil machines and would choose one over rotary any day, it would be far to difficult to replicate with my knowledge so I was more inclined to go in the direction of a rotary design.

*Laser Stippling*

*https://www.laserstar.net/en/laserstar-tv/stippling-handgun-grips-with-a-laser-how-to-stipple-your-gun.html*

*This source doesn't exactly have much correlation with my project however, I found it incredibly cool. I came across this site when researching machines for stippling to see whether or not anyone had built anything similar to what I was wanting to build. I came across this site which uses a laser engraving machine to stipple designs onto handguns. The technology behind this is amazing and would potentially be able to be used to produce my portraits on a sheet of plastic or other various materials that can be laser cut. Just something cool I found.
